# Getting Started

## Option 1: No tools — GitHub in your browser
- Create or upload files directly on GitHub
- Commit with a message
- View history and diffs

## Option 2: GitHub Desktop (recommended for beginners)
- Download: https://desktop.github.com/
- Sign in → Clone your repo → Add or edit files locally
- Commit (with a message) → Push

## Option 3: VS Code (with built-in Git)
- Open your folder in VS Code
- Use the **Source Control** panel to stage, commit, and push

> You can switch between approaches anytime. Your **Git history** stays consistent.
