# What is Git?
Git is a **version control system**: it tracks changes to your files over time, so you can:
- See what changed and when
- Revert mistakes safely
- Collaborate without overwriting each other’s work

## Key terms (in plain English)
- **Repository (repo):** A project folder tracked by Git
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your changes + a message
- **Branch:** A separate line of work
- **Merge:** Combine changes from one branch into another
- **Remote:** A copy of your repo hosted on GitHub
