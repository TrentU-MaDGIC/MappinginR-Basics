# Mapping in R: Basics
If you want to create a basic map of your study area using open-source tools and replicable methods, then this workshop is for you. Join James Marcaccio, GIS and Data Systems Specialist, for this introduction to creating basic maps using R. You'll learn how to
- identify packages and basic functions for mapping in R
- import and generate geospatial data
- plot your data on a map for use in a research paper or poster.
**Prerequisites:** Attendees must have a working version of R and RStudio to participate in this workshop. Prior experience in R is required. While we will cover some basics, it is expected that participants know how to install and load packages, define variables, and create and run functions in RStudio. 

> **Who is this for?** Beginners who want a fast, hands-on understanding of R mapping basics.
